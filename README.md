# Add MySQL binaries to your Heroku app

This Heroku buildpack adds MySQL binaries to your app. Useful if your application uses MySQL utilities like `mysqldump`.

## Installation

Add the URL of this repository to your app's buildpacks:

```bash
https://github.com/musa11971/heroku-buildpack-mysql-binaries
```

## Usage
The buildpack requires you to first declare which version of the MySQL binaries you would like to have installed. Do this by adding a new config (environment) variable named `MYSQL_BINARIES_VERSION`.

The following versions are currently supported: 8.0.23, 5.7.33.  
If your desired version is not listed, don't worry. File a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/musa11971/heroku-buildpack-mysql-binaries/issues) and I will promptly add your version.  
  
The buildpack will automatically install the MySQL binaries and add them to the PATH.
